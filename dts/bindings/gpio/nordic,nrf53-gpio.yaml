      description:
        GPIO is implemented with split security. If it has been configured as
        non-secure it can be accessed by both secure and non-secure accesses.
        A bitmask can be set to configure a subset of the GPIO pins as secure
        to prevent non-secure from accessing these pin. Secure accesses can be
        made to GPIO pins configured as non-secure.
